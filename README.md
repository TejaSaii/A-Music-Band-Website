# A-modern-website-html-css-js
This website is based on a webpage of a music band (One-direction in this case)
A website built completely on html, css and vanilla javascript.
I built it to strengthen my basics on front-end development.
It has three pages in it which can be navigated to using the top nav bar
    - HOME
    - STORE
    - ABOUT  
It also has a static footer at the end with icons to social media sites
###The toughest part of this entire project was to create a shop area at the STORE
page and a Cart, which allows user to add items to the cart, delete items from the
cart, update quantity, and update the total price of the cart based on the user
actions.
