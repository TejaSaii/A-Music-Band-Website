# Music Band Website - One Direction

This project is a music band website based on the popular band One Direction. It's built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The primary goal of this project was to strengthen foundational skills in front-end web development.

## Features

- Three main pages accessible from the top navigation bar:
  - Home
  - Store
  - About

- Static footer with social media icons for easy access to social media profiles.

## Store and Cart Functionality

One of the most challenging aspects of this project was the implementation of the store area and the cart on the Store page. This section allows users to perform the following actions:

- Add items to the cart
- Delete items from the cart
- Update the quantity of items in the cart
- Update the total price of the cart based on user actions

This project served as a great learning opportunity and allowed me to practice various front-end development concepts, including responsive design, navigation implementation, interactivity, and data management.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
